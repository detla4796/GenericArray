# GenericArray Implementation

A generic C# class that stores elements of any type in a dynamic array, with methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements by index.

## Features
- **Add elements**: Dynamically add items of any type.
- **Remove elements**: Remove items by index (with bounds checking).
- **Get elements**: Retrieve items by index (with exception handling for invalid indices).
- **Type-safe**: Built using generics to ensure type consistency.
